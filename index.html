													<h2>Abstract</h2>
												</header>
												<p>The slow adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled agents that operate in dynamic real-world
													environments is in many instances due to the lack of model resilience and robustness to previously unseen
													real-world data, often leading to unpredictable behavior after deployment. This is true, for example, in
													commercial applications such as autonomous driving or human-robot interaction, and in military applications
													such as object recognition. It is therefore critical in many applications that the AI models generalize to new
													environment variations and scenarios. There are several approaches that one could consider, ranging from
													synthetic data augmentation approaches such as Sim2Real for robotics or incremental and continuous
													learning where an AI model dynamically adapts without forgetting what it has learned in the past. In this
													workshop, we seek novel advances in the development of AI models that are robust to distributional shifts in
													the data used to train AI models when deployed in dynamic environments. Emphasis will be placed on AI-
													models operating on multivariate time-series signals which are of relevance in signal processing.</p>

													<h2>Introduction</h2>
												</header>
												<p>
													It is common to train an AI model using a curated data corpus prior to its operational deployment in the real
													world. The data used to train the model, however, may not fully capture either the distribution of the data the
													AI model encounters in practice or the way the distribution of the data may change over time. This can result
													in an AI model with unexpected behavior during operation.
													In mission critical AI-enabled applications such as object identification in defense missions or autonomous
													driving in densely populated urban areas, unpredictable behavior results in a risk to human safety. This has
													resulted in a reluctance to adopt AI-enabled agents in open and dynamic environments for a wide range of
													applications where unpredictable behavior poses a substantial risk.
													Past research to address distributional shifts have included synthetic data augmentation, principally targeted
													at addressing categorical imbalance in classification problems and zero-shot learning to recognize categories
													of objects without ever having seen examples of these beforehand, but with mixed results. Synthetic data
													augmentation is particularly susceptible to not generalizing to real world phenomenology due to a lack of
													fidelity in the synthetic data generation process. Zero-shot learning rarely matches the performance of
													supervised learning as it relies heavily on accurate and informative semantic embeddings or attributes for
													unseen classes, that when poorly defined, result in significant performance degradation.
													There recently have been efforts to improve the generalization of models using synthetic data, such as
													Sim2Real, where the discrepancy between simulated and real-world data - or the reality gap - is minimized, or
													physics-informed models that may require less training data. There also have been models developed that are
													able to continually learn without catastrophic forgetting by leveraging transfer learning with regularization or

													task segmentation to enable adaptation to changes in environmental conditions. The main direction of this
													workshop is to explore advances in AI that address a core shortcoming of many AI-enabled models: robust
													operation in the face of distributional shifts from the training set after deployment in dynamic environments.
													While the focus of this workshop is on research that enables AI models to generalize in the face of distributional
													shifts, emphasis will be placed on AI models that operate on multivariate time-series data from EO/IR, RF and
													acoustic sensors, which are of particular interest in signal processing. We believe this workshop is
													complementary to the main conference, as ICASSP is predominantly focused on signal processing, though in
													recent years it has expanded its technical scope to include computer vision and deep learning. Within the
													broader area of deep learning, we are targeting a unique, but important, topic for this workshop of AI-enabled
													model robustness to distributional shifts in multi-modal data encountered during deployment. Though our
													motivation is seemingly applied (i.e., operationalizing AI-enabled models for real-world applications), much
													fundamental research is still needed to understand the distribution shift phenomenon and develop new
													approaches to improve the generalizability of these models. In addition to the emerging research mentioned

													previously that seeks to address distributional shifts, signal processing approaches can also be applied to pre-
													process multi-modal data, especially time-series data, to “condition” the data prior to learning/training with

													AI architectures to improve model robustness. We believe these set of unique research challenges and
													corresponding emerging research directions warrants a dedicated workshop outside the main conference.
													The proposed workshop is highly interdisciplinary, as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) is an
													enabling technology cross-cutting many fields, expanding broadly from computer vision that was the original
													application area. We believe this workshop is synergistic to a multitude of other IEEE technical societies,
													especially to the Computer Society, Biomedical Engineering Society, Geoscience and Remote Sensing
													Society, Industry Applications Society, and Intelligent Transportation Systems Society. We appreciate the
													consideration of this proposed workshop by the ICASSP workshop chairs and workshop proposal reviewers
													and look forward to the opportunity to hold this workshop at ICASSP 2025.
